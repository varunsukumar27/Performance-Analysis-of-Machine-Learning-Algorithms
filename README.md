# Performance-Analysis-of-Machine-Learning-Algorithms

Coded custom Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests and Support Vector Machine algorithms in PYTHON to study the performance of said algorithms. Web Scraped 20000+ yelp reviews along with star rating to use as the dataset to study the algorithms.

Evaluated the algorithm using different feature set sizes and k-fold Cross Validations. Identified the algorithm that performed the best using a pair-wise t-test on the model performance results. Random Forests performed better than the other algorithms by 7.9%.
